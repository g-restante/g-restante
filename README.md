## 💻 About Me

I’m a backend developer (and part-time bug hunter 🐛🔫).  
I specialize in **Java** and **Python**, building over-engineered systems that automate everything — sometimes even what doesn’t really need to be automated 😅.  
If a system can run on its own, monitor itself, and alert me when something’s wrong, I’m happy.

### ⚙️ What I Do (and Enjoy)

- 🤖 Build smart, self-sufficient, “possibly-too-clever” backend systems  
- 📐 Focus on clean architecture, solid design, and performance that doesn't break under pressure  
- 🔧 Automate the boring stuff — and sometimes the fun stuff too  
- 🧠 Always learning: new tech, better patterns, and cleaner ways to do more with less
